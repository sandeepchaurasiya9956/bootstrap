Inheritence:-
deriving the properties (member) and features(methods) from parent to child class is called as inheritence.

Inheritence may defined as the mechanism of re-useability.
using the Readymade Items (Data member + Member Function) from  existing class is a concept of Re-useability 
inheritence.

Basic Terms Related to, Inheritence
1. Multi-Level class :

2. Independent class :if one class donot  depend on any other class then it is called independent. 

3. Dependent class (Relationship):if any class utilieses the, features of any existing ready-made class then 
      this is called as dependent class and its set-ups a relationship B/W Both of them.
  
  
Question : How will you sort a Array
Ans: Using pre-defined Function

1. sort(): sorting on values : aescending order
2. rsort : sorting on values in reverse order : descending order.

2. asort : associative sorting on values.
3. ksort : sort the keys in Ascendiing order.

4. arsort: reverse sorting on ascending order.
5. krsort: reverse sorting on keys of Associative Array

Types of Inheritence:-
**********************
1. Single Inheritence
2. multi-lavel inheritence
3. Heiriechal inheritence
4. multiple inheritence
5. hybrid inheritence
6. cyclic inheritence

One of the best use case of inheritence is applied on file Inclusion and In Laravel This Cocnept is called 
Template Inheritence.

=> What is file-inclusion:-
extending the source code from one file another is called as file-inclusion.

Types of error in php :_123total
*************************************
Note : we have 16 types of error lavel
Don't get confuse B/W error level and legal error.
Legal Error,We disturb the execution of the program.
where as error level will raised only after program is successfully Running.

1. Parse Error : if these error occur, program execution will not take place.

2. Syntax Error : if these Error occur, Program execution will not take place.

But in case of error level for ex: Undefined index error is Notice_Error will generates Error, But donot 
the execution of the program.

Ex2: Depecation Error, due to PHP standards there may be a chance, that you are using the latest
 version of php but you are using some features which are of old legacy version in that scenerio, you will
 get Depraction Error instead of terminatiog the program.
 
   1. Syntax Error (parse error,compilation Error):
   if occured No single line will not execute.

   2. Notice or Warning error:
    if occured then Notice Error or warning error is raised But, it will not affect the code just 
	below the, Error line that is it do-not stop the, execution of the program.
	
  3.Fetal Error : 
   if occured then no line below the code will execute ever.Until resolved.
   
  4. PHP Standards Error OR Exception
  This type of Error, occur due to logical Mistakes,  which need to be either resolved 
  or Handled using Exception Handling, Sometimes These error can be critical Like Fetal Error
    Uncaught Error.
  

Ans: Using User-Defined Function

 1. Has Relationship : it is logical relationship B/W one or more class.
                      This is by-default Relationship and called Inheritence.
                       
					   In order to achieve Inheritence we need extends Keywords.
					   
					   <child-class> will all Properties [extends] from <parent>
		
	 In order to Achieve Inheritence we require, at-least two multi-label class.
     
	 1. Parent class: This is Independent class.
     2. Child class : This is Dependent Class over parent class.
	 
	 NOTE ::
	 Syntax:-
	       Parent class/ Master class/Super class/Derived class/Inherted class.
		   
		  Child-class/Sub-class/Inherting class/Deriving class.
	 
	 
  2. Is Relationship : it is physical relationship B/W one or more class.
                       This is explicit Relationship and called as Composition/Aggregation
				
	In order to achieve Is-Inheritence we need to explicitly make object of Any Class which want to use,you need
	to inside own class.
	
	Inside own class:-
	=> syntax:---
	
	class A{
	
	public function B(){
	  $b = new classB();
	  $b->someMethod();
	
	}
	}
 
 Difference B/W all of these :-
 ******************************
 
1. include : Includes the files successfully and multiple-times if found successfully if not found generates
             notice error or warning error.
			 
2. include_once : Includes the files successfully and once only even if we add these lines multiple times.
    if found successfully if not found generates notice error or warning error.
                
3. require : Means files is highly required, without this file execution of the code not be generated hence
             if file is found it is loaded successfully otherwise it generated fetal error. and we can include
			 the same file multiple times;.
			 
4. require_once : In require same file cannot be included multiple times. and if not found it will 
                  generate the Error.
				  
Type :      include           |include_once         require               |require_once
file
loading     multiple times      only once.          multiple times.        Only once.
Error       warning error       warning error       fetal error            fetal error
Memory      more                less                more                   less

Access Modifiers:-
******************
Access Modifiers are verbs when added before any Instance Variable or method, makes it hidden from 
   the different scopes.
   
Possible Number of Scopes :-
1. From outside the class(Public)
2. From Inside th4 class(Private)
3. From Child Class(Protector)

Difference B/W Public,Private,        

Location :       Public   |     Protected     |Private
*******************************************************
outside class :   valid   |   -------         |----
inside class :    valid   |  valid            |valid
child class :     valid   |  valid            |-----

Method chaining in PHP:
**********************       
chaining one method with different method without destroying the instance is called as method chaining.
  It is widely used by laravel,codeIgnitor and MVC Frameworks.
  
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
Introduction to PDBC (PHP Database Connectivity)
************************************************
PDBC: Connecting PHP Application with Database is called php database connectivity.

why PDBC ?
If we want to make application where storage of data is important such that using that data one can 
drive entire, Enterprise then we require database.
